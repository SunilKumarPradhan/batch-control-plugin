# Batch Control

Run approval, time-boxed change permissions and an append-only audit history for
Jenkins instances that are operated as a **batch execution manager** rather than
as a CI server.

It is for teams whose nightly and periodic production workload runs on Jenkins,
where starting a job by hand or changing what it does is an operational change.
Installing the plugin changes nothing by itself: both controls are off until an
administrator turns them on.

## Key features

- **Run approval.** A person's manual run of a protected job (Build Now, REST,
  CLI, Replay) is refused at queue entry and becomes a run request. Only the
  designated approvers may decide it, and the approved build gets exactly the
  parameters they saw, once.
- **Activation.** A job created while run control is on does not run on a
  timer, upstream trigger, SCM trigger or webhook until an approver activates
  it. Existing jobs keep their schedules.
- **Permission windows.** A user without standing rights requests `CREATE`,
  `CONFIGURE` or `DELETE` on one job or folder for a limited time; the window
  closes by itself.
- **Audit history independent of builds.** Runs, requests, decisions,
  configuration changes with diffs, and failures are kept append-only under
  `$JENKINS_HOME/batch-control/`, with history screens and CSV export.
- **Incidents.** Failed and unstable runs open an incident with the last 100
  console lines, to acknowledge, resolve and rerun through a request.
- **Fits your security setup.** Works through Batch Control variants of Matrix
  Authorization Strategy and Role-based Authorization Strategy; e-mail
  notifications (off by default); configurable with Configuration as Code.

## Screenshots

The frames drawn on each screenshot mark where to look.

### 1. Set it up (administrator)

**Administrator:** turns on run control, change control or both, and lists the
approvers.

![Batch Control section of Manage Jenkins → System. One frame surrounds the Enable run control and Enable change control checkboxes, both checked; another surrounds the Approvers list, which holds approver-1, approver-2 and admin. The other settings follow, down to Send e-mail notifications.](docs/images/global-config.png)

### 2. Run a protected job (run control)

**Requester:** chooses **Request Run** on a job that requires approval, gives a
reason and picks the approvers.

![Request Run form of the job batch » daily-settlement, with Request Run selected in the job's sidebar. A frame surrounds the Reason field, filled in, and the Approvers checkboxes, where approver-1 is checked and approver-2 and admin are not. The job's three build parameters and the Submit Request button follow.](docs/images/request-run.png)

**Approver:** reads the reason and the parameters, then chooses **Approve** or
**Reject**.

![Pending run request for batch/daily-settlement as its approver sees it: status PENDING, the requester, the approver, the reason, the three parameter values and the job's two recent runs. Under Decision, one frame surrounds the Approve button and another the Reject button.](docs/images/approval.png)

**Anyone with the `BatchControl/ViewHistory` permission:** finds that request in
**History** and sees who asked, who decided and that it ran.

![Batch Control History page in its Requests view, listing eight run requests with their job, requester, approvers, who decided, status, and created and decided times. A frame surrounds the first row: batch/daily-settlement, requested by requester, decided by approver-1, EXECUTED. Of the other seven, four are EXECUTED, one is PENDING, one CANCELLED and one REJECTED.](docs/images/history.png)

### 3. Change a job safely (change control)

**Requester:** requests a permission window, here `CONFIGURE` on one job for 60
minutes, and gives a reason.

![Request Change Permission form, prefilled for the job batch/nightly-load. One frame surrounds Actions, where Configure is checked and Create and Delete are not, and Duration, set to 60 minutes; another surrounds the Reason field, filled in. Two approvers are checked below, above the Request Grant button.](docs/images/permission-window.png)

**Approver:** reads the request, then chooses **Approve** or **Reject**. An
approved window closes by itself when the time is up.

![Pending permission window request, titled Grant Request, as its approver sees it: Freestyle project batch/nightly-load, action CONFIGURE, 60 minutes, status PENDING, the requester, the approvers and the reason, with a note that the window does not allow renaming and a warning about the account builds run as. Under Decision, one frame surrounds the Approve button and another the Reject button.](docs/images/permission-window-approval.png)

## Requirements

- **Jenkins 2.568.3 or newer** on **Java 21 or 25**.
- **Required plugins:** `cloudbees-folder`, `ionicons-api` and `caffeine-api`,
  resolved for you on installation.
- **An authorization strategy that draws a permission matrix**, such as Matrix
  Authorization Strategy or Role-based Authorization Strategy; the Batch
  Control permissions cannot be assigned on "Logged-in users can do anything".

Batch Control loads without these plugins; if one is installed, it must be at
least this version:

| Optional plugin | Minimum version |
|---|---|
| `matrix-auth` | 3.3 |
| `role-strategy` | 927.v9cf5527c4085 |
| `configuration-as-code` | 2121.v86fe99d4b_b_a_b_ |
| `mailer` | 534.v1b_36f5864073 |
| `rebuild` | 338.va_0a_b_50e29397 |
| `file-parameters` | 433.va_0b_80359d54d |

With an older version installed Batch Control does not load. **Plugins →
Available plugins** offers the upgrade; **Deploy Plugin** does not, so upgrade
first.

## Installation

Install from **Manage Jenkins → Plugins → Available plugins** (search for
*Batch Control*), or upload a build under **Advanced settings → Deploy Plugin**.
Building needs Maven and JDK 21 or 25: `mvn clean package` produces
`target/batch-control.hpi`.

## Quick start

1. In **Manage Jenkins → System → Batch Control**, check **Enable run control**
   (and **Enable change control** for permission windows), list the approvers'
   user IDs under **Approvers**, and save.
2. For change control only, select the Batch Control strategy: the monitor on
   **Manage Jenkins** offers **Install the Batch Control variant**
   ([details](docs/USER-GUIDE.md#2-select-a-batch-control-authorization-strategy)).
3. Give requesters `BatchControl/Request` and approvers `BatchControl/Approve`,
   both with `Overall/Read` and `Item/Read`.
4. On a job, check **Require approval to run** (section **Batch Control**).
5. The requester chooses **Request Run** on the job, fills in the parameters, a
   reason and the approvers, and submits.
6. The approver opens **Batch Control** (in the **☰** menu) → **Run Requests**
   and chooses **Approve** or **Reject**. On approval the build is queued.

Jobs created while run control is on need an approved activation before they run
unattended ([Activation](docs/USER-GUIDE.md#activation-putting-a-job-into-service)).
The full setup is in the [user guide](docs/USER-GUIDE.md#configuration).

## Permissions

| Permission | What it allows |
|---|---|
| `BatchControl/Request` | Create run, activation and hold requests (with `Item/Read` on the job; `Item/Build` is not required) |
| `BatchControl/Approve` | Approve or reject run, activation, hold and window requests |
| `BatchControl/RequestGrant` | Request temporary change permissions |
| `BatchControl/ViewHistory` | View the history screens, dashboards and CSV exports, for every job |
| `BatchControl/Manage` | Manage the global configuration and revoke windows (implied by `Overall/Administer`) |
